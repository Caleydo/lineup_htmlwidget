## LineUp HTMLWidget in R Markdown

This is a simple example how to include the LineUp [HTMLWidget](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) in your R Markdown file

```{r libraries}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/crosstalk")
# devtools::install_github("sgratzl/lineup_htmlwidget")

library(crosstalk)
library(lineup)
```

## Simple Example

```{r lineup}

lineup(iris)
```


## Cross Talk

The LineUp HTMLWidget supports [Crosstalk](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) to sync selection and filtering among widgets. 

```{r crosstalk}
shared_mtcars = SharedData$new(mtcars)

list(
  filter_checkbox("cyl", "Cylinders", shared_mtcars, ~cyl, inline = TRUE),
  filter_slider("hp", "Horsepower", shared_mtcars, ~hp, width = "100%")
)

lineup(shared_mtcars)
```
