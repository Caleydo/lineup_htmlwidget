Title: 'HTMLWidget' Wrapper of 'LineUp' for Visual Analysis of Multi-Attribute Rankings
Description: 'LineUp' is an interactive technique designed to create, visualize and explore rankings of items based on a set of heterogeneous attributes.
  This is a 'htmlwidget' wrapper around the JavaScript library 'LineUp.js'.
  It is designed to be used in 'R Shiny' apps and 'R Markddown' files.
  Due to an outdated 'webkit' version of 'RStudio' it won't work in the intergrated viewer.
